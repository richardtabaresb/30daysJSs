    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    //console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    //console.log(age, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    //console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'hola'
    console.log(team4)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12})
    console.log(cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    cap3.number = 1234
    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
